# Praktikum_FF

This repository contains a floght simulation programmed as an assignment for "Praktikum Fluegfuehrung" by Prof. Dr. Thomas Grauschopf. 

## Functionality

This program runs a VR simulation of a character being able to enter a spaceship by opening its door and subsequently flying it using the provided virtual joystick. The spsaceship is also provided with a button, which - when pressed - toggles the HUD.   

As an ulterior to-do point of this assignment, two screen recordings are required. One recording contains a demonstration of the very first assignment "rollaballVR" and the otehr one provides an overview of the simulation. These can be found under the following link : 

## About the simulation video

The second video was divided into two parts, one representing each scene. This is due to the fact that a bug occurred during the development of the simulation, which did not allow the user to set the order of the scenes played by Unity Engine. The Internet sadly did not provide any valuable solution to this issue, nor did @maf0115 's own attempts.
