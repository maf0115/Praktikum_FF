# Praktikum_FF

This repository contains a floght simulation programmed as an assignment for "Praktikum Fluegfuehrung" by Prof. Dr. Thomas Grauschopf. 

## Functionality

This program runs a VR simulation of a character being able to enter a spaceship by opening its door and subsequently flying it using the provided virtual joystick. The spsaceship is also provided with a button, which - when pressed - toggles the HUD.   

As an ulterior to-do point of this assignment, two screen recordings are required. One recording contains a demonstration of the very first assignment "rollaballVR" and the otehr one provides an overview of the simulation. These can be found under the following link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19gZFV0YLDHjmefy8zvKjR0K_D_h1dpma
